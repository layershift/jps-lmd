*Linux Malware Detect (LMD) is a malware scanner for Linux released under the*
*GNU GPLv2 license, that is designed around the threats faced in shared hosted* 
*environments. It uses threat data from network edge intrusion detection*
*systems to extract malware that is actively being used in attacks and* 
*generates signatures for detection. In addition, threat data is also derived* 
*from user submissions with the LMD checkout feature and from malware* 
*community resources. The signatures that LMD uses are MD5 file hashes and HEX* 
*pattern matches, they are also easily exported to any number of detection* 
*tools such as ClamAV.*
